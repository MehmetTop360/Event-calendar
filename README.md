# Event Calendar with TRPC

This project's idea has been taken from https://github.com/joereynolds/what-to-code. The idea is changed to fit the sprint projects requirements more.

```
An online calendar that doesn't require login or auth. You create a calendar and get a permalink. Anyone with that permalink is free to add events etc...
```

This project is an online calendar application that allows users to create calendars, add, view, and remove events, and share these calendars with others via a permalink. The visitors can also add and view events to calendars. This application aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for calendar management and sharing.
